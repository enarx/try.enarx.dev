# A guide on how to use Try Enarx 🎯

A little amount of efforts are required but we will walk you through all of it. For instance, trying enarx in your own WASM files is a matter of few clicks. Our goal is to understand how it 
happens step by step by *learning and doing*.

# Few insights on Try Enarx
* Enarx supports [Webassembly](https://webassembly.org/) and WASM time. It heavily works on it. So try to find out what these terms actually mean to us and why we use it?
* Converting your files into WASM file can be easily done with the help of [Webassembly-guide](https://enarx.dev/docs/WebAssembly/Introduction). Also,with the comfort of your 
  familiar language. 
* Choose the language and implements Webassembly to it and then we're good to go( to try enarx with it).
