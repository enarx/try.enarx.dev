# A guide on how to use Try Enarx 🎯

We will walk you through how to try **Try Enarx**. For instance, trying Enarx with your own Wasm file is a matter of few clicks. Our goal is to understand how it happens step by step by *learning and doing*.

# Few insights on Try Enarx
* Enarx supports [Webassembly](https://webassembly.org/) by using wasmtime as a runtime. So try to find out what these terms actually mean to us and why we use it?
* Converting your files into a WASM file can be easily done with the help of [Webassembly-guide](https://enarx.dev/docs/WebAssembly/Introduction) with the language of your choice.
* Choose the language and implements Webassembly to it and then we're good to go.
